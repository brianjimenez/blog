Summary: A Python crash course for scientifics

Some years ago, I wrote a Python crash course for my colleagues at the Life Sciences department at Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

The goal was to answer as many possible questions researchers made themselves when they start using the Python programming language.

The course can be found online here: [Python in 4 hours](https://life.bsc.es/pid/brian/python/#/) and the source code for the slides in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brianjimenez/python-course).
